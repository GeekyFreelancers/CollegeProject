# C project ( C for College)

This is a feedback system project. Through this project, we will improve the outcome of the feedback's given by the
students for their teachers.

There are many drawbacks of the traditional system . Such as, some of the teachers were able to read that which feedback is given by whom.

So, to improve this we are developing a feedback system  in
which even the admin will only be able to see the outcome of the feedback was given by students for the respective teachers.

But there is  another problem that some students are not
regular in colleges(i.e. who come on five days out of thirty)
gives the feedback due to which it may harm the profile of a good teacher.As no one can judge anyone on the basis of two or three days meet(or can say irregular meet).

So, we will also develop our project in such a way that, the
feedbacks of such students will not affect the feedback of a teacher to such extent.
